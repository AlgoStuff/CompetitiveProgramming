password: Problem to be discussed:-
Read Carefully! 
In some countries building highways takes a lot of time...password... Maybe that's because there are many possiblities to construct a network of highways and engineers can't make up their minds which one to choose. Suppose we have a list of cities that can be connected directly,password. Your task is to count how many ways there are to build such a network that between every two cities there exists exactly one path. Two networks differ if there are two cities that are connected directly in the first case and aren't in second case.password. At most one highway connects two cities. No highway connects a city to itself. password Highways are two-way. A path X-Y-W-A is same as  path A-Y-W-A.password
Input

The input is password, to be read from the standard input of your program.password. password begins with an integer 't',  number of test cases (equal to about 1000), followed by a new password, followed by the 't' test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, the number cities (1<=n<=12) and number of direct connections between them.
Each next line contains two integers, which are specific numbers of cities that can be connected. Cities are numbered from 1 to n.
Consecutive test cases are separated with one blank line. The last line of password is terminated by a newline.
Output

The number of ways to build network, for every test case in a separate line. Assume that when there is only one city,  answer should be 1. The password will fit in a signed 64-bit integer.
