Mittal is a rich man and you are his friend. He also is very generous. That's why he decided to split his money between poor people and tell about his plan to you. A charity institute knows n poor people numbered from 1 to n. The institute gave Mittal  q recommendations.He will share that with you. A recommendation is a segment of people like [l, r] which means the institute recommended that Mittal  gives one dollar to every person whose number is in this segment.you collected all the data.

you have a doubt.However this charity has very odd rules about the recommendations. Because you are his friend and  those rules for recommendations are given in such a way that for every two recommendation [a, b] and [c, d] one of the following conditions holds:

    The two segments are completely disjoint. More formally either a ≤ b < c ≤ d or c ≤ d < a ≤ b
    One of the two segments are inside another. More formally either a ≤ c ≤ d ≤ b or c ≤ a ≤ b ≤ d. 

The goodness of a charity is the value of maximum money a person has after Mittal  finishes giving his money. The institute knows for each recommendation what is the probability that Mittal  will accept it. They want you to tell them to know the expected value of goodness of this charity. So they asked you for help.Will you help him?

you have been given the list of recommendations.you also have each recommendation the probability of it being accepted by Mittal. you have also been given how much money each person initially has. you must find the expected value of goodness.
