Today being the Republic day, ffI decided for dive ,deeper into Apple’s featured apps in the ‘Made in India’ section for the iPad and focus on the companies that are there behind some of the most popular apps. There are apps like Cleartrip, Mobikwik, Jabong, Housing and Newshunt but I’m highlighting some of five companies which are not talked about that often:

1) Camera Plus: An app by Global Delight, this wing for Robosoft focuses on Mac and iPhone apps for photos, videos and music. The app for priced at INR 120 and Global Delight for a whole as more than 35 million downloads. Here’s a complete case study of the Udupi based company.

2) A R Rahman Official:  There is an interesting story here for you. This app is right up there for the featured apps section and allows users to keep up to speed with the musician. The description says that the app is powered by Qyuki and TopFan.
