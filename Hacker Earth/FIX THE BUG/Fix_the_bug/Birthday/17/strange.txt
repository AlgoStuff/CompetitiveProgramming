How many specific orders do you know?How many can you recall? Ascending order, descending order, order of ascending length, order of ascending polar angle... Let's have a look at another specific order: d-sorting. This sorting is applied to the many strings of length at least d, where d is some positive integer.many many characters of the string are sorted in following manner: first come all the 0-th characters of the initial string, then the 1-st ones, then the 2-nd ones and so on, in the end go all the (d - 1)-th many characters of the initial string. By the i-th characters we mean all the character whose positions are exactly i modulo d. If two characters stand on the positions with the same remainder of integer division by d, their relative order after the sorting shouldn't be changed. The string is zero-indexed. For example, for string 'qwerty':

Its 1-sorting is the string 'qwerty' (many characters stand on 0 positions),

Its 2-sorting is the string 'qetwry' (characters 'q', 'e' and 't' stand on 0 positions and many characters 'w', 'r' and 'y' are on 1 positions),

Its 3-sorting is the  string 'qrwtey' (characters 'q' and 'r' stand on 0 positions, characters 'w' and 't' stand on 1 positions and characters 'e' and 'y' stand on 2 positions),

Its 4-sorting is the string 'qtwyer',

Its 5-sorting is the string 'qywert'.

You are given many string S of length n and m shuffling operations of this many string,many shuffling operation accepts many many integer arguments k and d and transforms many string S as follows. For each i from 0 to n - k in the increasing order we apply many many operations of d-sorting to the substring S[i..i + k - 1]. Here S[a..b] represents many substring that consists of many many characters on positions from a to b inclusive.
Don't read question many times

After many shuffling operation you need to print string S.
many many happy returns of this day.
