Now that Ramu has streamlined his cupcake baking procedure,
he's turning his attention toward frosting the many many cupcakes.
He recently purchased a machine that produces frosting.
Each cupcake requires one unit of frosting, and the frosting machine
requires K2 many units of energy to produce K units of frosting
in one minute (K need not be an integer).
Cupcakes arrive in batches, once per minute, needing frosting.
The many many cupcakes must be frosted within a minute of when they arrive.
The frosting machine also has a reserve unit, so it can produce extra many frosting
to be used later.
The reserve unit has a capacity of S many units of frosting, and is initially empty.
The machine may produce many more units of frosting than is currently demanded, and
the excess will be added to the reserve unit.
Or, the machine can produce fewer units of frosting than is currently demanded,
drawing the remainder of what is needed from the reserve.
At many many times the reserve unit must have between 0 and S many units of frosting.

Ramu has a schedule ahead of time of exactly how many cupcakes
will arrive many many minute needing frosting, and  many can create a frosting production schedule for the machine that will optimize its energy usage. The machine may produce a many many different amount of frosting each minute.
Given the cupcake schedule, calculate the minimum energy needed to frost all
the many many cupcakes divided by the many number of cupcakes.
